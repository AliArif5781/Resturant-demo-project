Here’s a complete guest homepage:
•	Modern, mobile-first, responsive
•	Vibrant animations
•	High-quality imagery
•	Uses “slick widgets” and micro-interactions
•	Includes actual text content you can copy-paste
I’ll refer to the restaurant generically as “Karahi Point” – swap the name/logo as needed.
________________________________________
1. Overall Concept for Guest Homepage
This is the page guests see when:
•	They scan the QR on the table (dine-in), or
•	They open the restaurant link from home (pickup / order-ahead).
Primary goals for the page:
1.	“Where am I?” → Clear restaurant identity
2.	“What can I do?” → Start ordering fast (browse, recommend, order-ahead)
3.	“What looks good?” → Beautiful dishes & deals
4.	“What’s my status?” → See active order
________________________________________
2. Layout Overview (Sections)
1.	Sticky header
2.	Hero: Welcome + quick actions + live status
3.	Dish of the Day & Today’s Deals (widget-style cards)
4.	Recommended for You (AI widget)
5.	Quick Categories (pills + carousel)
6.	Popular Now (horizontal swipe cards)
7.	Order Ahead Widget (if at home)
8.	Sticky Cart / Active Order widget
9.	Footer (light)
I’ll give content + design + animation for each.

3. Sticky Header
Design:
•	Transparent over hero at top; becomes solid on scroll.
•	Subtle blur & drop shadow when scrolling.
•	Left: restaurant logo (round) + “Karahi Point”
•	Center: small context pill
o	Dine-in · Table T12 (if QR)
o	Pickup · Choose time (if remote)
•	Right: icons (minimal):
o	Profile / initials (if logged in)
o	Language icon (🌐) if you want multilingual
Microcopy example:
•	Context pill text:
You’re at: Karahi Point Oakville
Animation:
•	On scroll: header slides slightly up and locks, background fades to solid.

4. Hero Section – Welcome + Quick Actions + Status
Background:
•	Full width gradient: deep navy → warm orange
•	A subtle animated pattern (blurred circles / gradient orbs)
•	On desktop: split layout; on mobile: stacked

Order from your phone. Skip the wait.
•	Main heading:
Good evening, let’s get your food started.
•	Subheading:
Browse the full Karahi Point menu, get smart suggestions, and order without waiting for a server.
Quick action buttons (widgets in a row):

Subtext (small): “Browse menu & add items”
•	Secondary pill buttons (inline):

“Let AI pick something for you”

4.2 Right side – Hero Visual
Widget: Floating device + food
•	Centered phone mockup showing:

•	Overlapping smaller cards floating around:

o	Small QR code tile (“Scan again to reopen menu”)
o	“Order Ready” badge
Animation ideas:
•	Very slow float/bob animation for the cards (CSS keyframes).
•	Subtle parallax on mouse move (desktop) – cards move slightly.
•	On mobile: keep simpler; slow fade and small vertical movement.
Image guidelines:
•	High-quality food shots (biryani, karahi, naan).
•	Bright, saturated colors; shallow depth of field.
